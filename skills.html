              <p class="leading-relaxed text-base mb-4">CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. Here are some key points about CSS:
                 Styling: CSS controls the layout, colors, fonts, and overall appearance of web pages, allowing developers to apply styles separately from HTML structure.
                Box Model: Every HTML element is considered a box with properties like margin, border, padding, and content. Understanding the box model is essential for proper layout design.
              Layout Techniques: CSS offers various methods for layout design, such as Flexbox and Grid, which provide more control over the arrangement of elements on a web page.
                Responsive Design: CSS supports responsive design techniques, allowing web pages to adjust their layout to different screen sizes using media queries.</p>
